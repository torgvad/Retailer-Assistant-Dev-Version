# Retailer-Assistant-Dev-Version
This is the developer version my my senior capstone: Online Retailer Assistant. If you want the executable version or want to learn about the nature of this project please go to: https://github.com/torgvad/Retailer-Assistant. This version is meant for anyone wanting to modify or add more websites to my existing project. There is thorough instruction in the DEV_README.pdf which lays out how to add more websites to the program.
