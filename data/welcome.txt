Welcome to the Online Retailer Assistant. This appears to be your first time using the app.
    Here are the feature of the program:
    The searches tab is used to add new requests.
    Simply type in your query, what website you want scraped, select the time interval, and fill in any additional filters.
    Be careful with the time interval as excessive results will trigger the program to delete that query.
    Seperate words/phrases put in the Exclude field with commas or else the program will interpret what you typed as one continuous phrase.
    The large textbox will automatically be populated with new queries which you can click to go to that item's page.


    The queries and data tab allows you to look at existing queries and see what items have already been scraped for it.
    Here you can check what queries are being searched for, the item listings for those queries,
    Save item listings to a .txt file, or just look at what listings have been scraped
    Like the previous tab the items in the large textbox are clickable.
    If you need to refer to this intro again click on the "About" button on the bottom left of the window.
